# kzar's Kinesis Advantage keymap

A simple UK layout aiming to emulate the original controller. Targets the kinT
keyboard controller built with the Teensy 3.6 microcontroller.

Notes:

 - Windows key changed to LGUI (instead of RGUI) as that works better with the
   software that I use.
 - To flash the keyboard again, toggle the keypad (keypd) and then press
   RESET (F9).
 - This layout is based on the xyvers layout.
