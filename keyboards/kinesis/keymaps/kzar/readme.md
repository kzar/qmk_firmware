# Dave's Kinesis Advantage keymap

Kinesis Advantage keymap aiming to emulate the stock controller. QWERTY, DVORAK,
WIN, MAC, PC, program and keypad layers are all supported, along with the
keypad LED and RESET + STATUS keys.

Tested with a Kinesis Advantage2, kinT (stapelberg) keyboard controller built
with a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller and a UK system layout. Originally based upon
the xyvers keymap.

## Todo

 - Once support for the Teensy 3.6's EEPROM is added to QMK, persist the
   WIN/MAC/PC thumb keys mode.
 - Once support for kint36 has been merged into QMK, get this keymap merged too.
